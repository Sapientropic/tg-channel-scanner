# Testing And Quality Gates

This is the canonical local command index for repository verification. CI is
still the platform authority; these gates are the expected local evidence before
committing or asking for review.

## Rules

- Run focused tests first for fast feedback, then run the broader gate that
  matches the change risk.
- In a dirty worktree, mixed working-tree tests do not prove the commit. For a
  checkpoint commit, verify the staged index or a clean `HEAD` archive.
- Credential-free and dry-run paths are the default. Live Telegram, LLM, and
  notification delivery checks require explicit operator intent.
- Contract changes must update fixture coverage before being called stable.

## Fast Contract And Privacy Gate

Use this for schema, sanitizer, privacy, report-contract, and dashboard-boundary
changes:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/test_contract_fixtures.py tests/test_report_contracts.py tests/test_contract_privacy_fixtures.py tests/test_dashboard_state_contracts.py tests/test_desk_contract_fixtures.py tests/test_desk_source_access_contracts.py tests/test_agent_semantic_fallback.py tests/test_report.py -q
```

```powershell
Push-Location dashboard
npm test -- --run contract-privacy-fixtures dashboard-state-contract-fixtures desk-contract-fixtures desk-source-access-contract-fixtures client-contract-fixtures sanitize client
Pop-Location
```

## Medium V0.5 Backend Gate

Use this for monitor, dashboard server, bot gateway, and decision-state changes:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/test_monitor.py tests/test_monitor_state.py tests/test_dashboard_server.py tests/test_bot_gateway.py tests/test_decision_intelligence.py -q
```

## Full Local Gate

Run this before claiming broad branch health, after shared refactors, and before
handoff when time allows:

```powershell
python -m ruff check .
python -m pytest -q
Push-Location dashboard
npm test -- --run
npm run build
Pop-Location
git diff --check
```

## Staged Snapshot Gate

Use this when the worktree has unrelated WIP. It checks only files currently in
the git index, so the result is valid evidence for the next commit.

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
$repo = (Get-Location).Path
$temp = Join-Path ([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) ('tgcs-staged-' + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N'))
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $temp | Out-Null
try {
  git checkout-index -a -f --prefix="$temp\"
  Push-Location $temp
  python -m ruff check .
  python -m pytest -q
  Pop-Location
  $nodeModules = Join-Path $repo 'dashboard\node_modules'
  if (Test-Path $nodeModules) {
    New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path (Join-Path $temp 'dashboard\node_modules') -Target $nodeModules | Out-Null
  }
  Push-Location (Join-Path $temp 'dashboard')
  npm test -- --run
  npm run build
  Pop-Location
} finally {
  while ((Get-Location).Path -ne $repo) { Pop-Location }
  $junction = Join-Path $temp 'dashboard\node_modules'
  if (Test-Path $junction) { Remove-Item -LiteralPath $junction -Force }
  if ($temp.StartsWith([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath())) {
    Remove-Item -LiteralPath $temp -Recurse -Force
  }
}
```

For a narrow checkpoint, replace the full `ruff`, `pytest`, and `npm test`
commands in the snapshot with the targeted commands that match the staged
files. Record that scope in the commit note or iteration log.

## Extra Gates

- Dashboard layout or responsive CSS: run
  `python tools/quality_visual_audit.py <output-dir>`.
- Launcher or shell-script changes: run the matching CI syntax and line-ending
  checks for the touched platform.
- HTTP mutation or desktop action changes: include loopback, content-type, and
  fixed-argv negative tests.
- New JSON contract or payload field changes: add or update fixtures under
  `tests/fixtures/contracts/` and cover both Python producers and TypeScript
  consumers where both exist.

## Limits

These gates do not prove live Telegram availability, live LLM/provider behavior,
or human acceptance of product semantics. Treat those as separate operator
checks.
