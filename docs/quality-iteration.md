# Signal Desk Quality Iteration

Current truth for the 2026-05-11 quality loop. Product rules stay in `.frontend-design-context.md` and `docs/v0.5-alpha-alert-review-inbox.md`; this file only tracks this time-boxed review and repair run.

## Operating Contract

- Mode: Integrity.
- Intake: option-button intake was unavailable in this Default-mode runtime; the user explicitly selected `1A2A3A`: continue useful slices until the deadline, use Integrity gate, and prioritize Runs timeline / Recent Evidence de-duplication next.
- Reviewer gate: use Orchestra profiles with concrete `assign / poll / show / rate`. KIMI is required for product/interaction critique; Gemini is preferred for broad visual/product critique; Qwen audits process integrity and overclaim risk.
- Stop condition: keep opening useful, checkpointable slices until 2026-05-11 13:00 +08:00, then write the final handoff.
- Scope: Signal Desk dashboard across desktop/mobile, generated report touchpoints where linked from Desk, README/ROADMAP/doc truth-source hygiene.
- User lens: ordinary app user, ADHD, low tolerance for duplicate prose, strong preference for visual decision surfaces.
- Non-claim: tests and builds are only evidence. Visual/UX quality must be checked in rendered pages.

## Evidence So Far

- Memory recalled the existing Dashboard direction: ADHD-friendly triage, one judgment / one visual shape / one next step, repository controls out of main boards.
- Browser evidence: screenshots captured under `output/quality-review/20260511-0200/` for Inbox, Start, Profiles, Runs, and Settings at desktop 1440x1000 and mobile 390x844.
- Screenshot audit JSON: `output/quality-review/20260511-0200/screenshot-audit.json`.
- Reviewer B reported P1 documentation duplication across README / README.zh-CN / ROADMAP versus `docs/v0.5-alpha-alert-review-inbox.md`, plus a privacy-copy contradiction.
- Orchestra/KIMI re-audit `11700c4a7a79` reported that the desk is not acceptance-ready: Iteration 7 improved audit numbers but did not solve the largest UX failures.

## Current Verdict

Cannot claim acceptance readiness yet.

The highest current blockers are interaction/information-architecture problems, not build or test failures. Runs, Settings, and mobile Review have been materially reduced, but external review is degraded because Gemini failed and the latest KIMI P1 fixes still need follow-up pressure before acceptance can be claimed.

## Repair Roadmap

1. UI slice 1 - app-user noise and trust:
   - Put Add Sources before Saved Sources in Settings.
   - Reduce the initial saved-source page size so Settings does not start as a long source dump.
   - Fix token privacy copy to say secrets stay local / tokens are never shown, not never saved.
   - Align navigation language around Review instead of Inbox/Review split.

2. Docs slice 1 - single truth source:
   - Keep README focused on opening Signal Desk and basic app flow.
   - Move or collapse v0.5 monitor/Dashboard implementation detail into pointers to `docs/v0.5-alpha-alert-review-inbox.md`.
   - Keep ROADMAP at phase intent and exit criteria, not completed hardening logs.

3. UI slice 2 - mobile Review and Settings polish:
   - Re-test after slice 1.
   - Fix remaining touch targets below 44px where they are primary actions.
   - Re-check card text truncation and filter density on 390px mobile.

4. Verification / review loop:
   - After each slice: rebuild or typecheck, rerun focused tests, recapture screenshots, and triage reviewer reports.
   - Commit checkpoint when a slice is coherent and verified enough to roll back.

5. Current next slice - reviewer follow-up and remaining app polish:
   - Re-check Settings after accepted KIMI P1 fixes.
   - Keep reducing first-viewport noise without hiding safety or maintenance controls.
   - Use another independent reviewer because Gemini failed again.

## Iteration 0 - Ground Truth And Plan

- Target: establish real page evidence and a non-duplicative plan before edits.
- Changes: added this iteration log and `docs/quality-task-state.md`.
- Verification: dashboard API healthy at `127.0.0.1:8765`; Vite app reachable at `127.0.0.1:5173`; screenshot set captured for 10 page/viewport combinations.
- External review: three same-workspace subagents launched; reviewer B completed with P1 docs/copy findings. Gate is degraded because this is not an external KIMI/GEMINI route.
- Triage: accept Settings ordering, privacy copy, naming alignment, and docs de-dup as first P1 fixes.
- Task state: planning; checkpoint not ready until UI slice 1 is implemented and verified.
- `needs_human`: final taste acceptance at user review.
- Residual risk: screenshots capture current local data shape; other private data shapes may reveal additional edge cases.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: screenshots and audit JSON kept under `output/quality-review/20260511-0200/` as evidence, not current docs.
- Next: implement UI slice 1.

## Iteration 1 - App-User Noise And Mobile Navigation

- Target: fix reviewer P0/P1 issues in mobile navigation, Settings source-wall ordering, and privacy copy.
- Changes:
  - `dashboard/src/styles/responsive.css`: mobile navigation is now a sticky top tab bar, not buried after long content; coarse mobile controls get larger hit areas.
  - `dashboard/src/components/settings.tsx`: Add Sources renders before Saved Sources; Saved Sources defaults to 8 rows instead of 24.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/settings/layout.css`: Settings grid now actually uses CSS grid, so source import and library can sit as action-first zones.
  - `dashboard/src/components/shell.tsx`: privacy copy changed from "Tokens are never saved" to "Secrets stay local."
  - `dashboard/src/main.tsx`: nav label aligned to Review; dialog focus restoration delayed to survive unmount cleanup.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/actions.css`: confirmation dialog secondary action is readable on the dark modal and buttons meet the 44px target.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 9 files / 67 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - `python -m pytest -q`: 338 passed, 49 subtests passed.
  - `python -m ruff check .`: passed.
  - `git diff --check`: passed, with only line-ending warnings.
  - Screenshot evidence after repair: `output/quality-review/20260511-0225/mobile-settings.visible.png`, `mobile-review.visible.png`, and `mobile-start.visible.png`.
- External review:
  - Reviewer A reported P0 mobile nav buried after content, P1 Settings source wall, P1 Start hierarchy, P2 Runs summary.
  - Reviewer C independently reported P1 mobile nav, P2 touch targets, P2 modal focus/contrast.
  - Gate remains degraded because reviewers are same-workspace subagents, not external KIMI/GEMINI.
- Triage:
  - Accepted and fixed: mobile nav visibility, Settings action-first ordering, smaller source list, token copy contradiction, mobile touch-target gaps for primary controls, modal contrast/focus.
  - Deferred: Start one-next-step hierarchy and Runs decision summary. They remain next UI candidates after docs cleanup.
- Task state: checkpoint ready after deterministic and screenshot verification.
- `needs_human`: final visual acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: private source data with longer labels may still need visual sampling after the next UI slice.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: retained screenshot sets under `output/quality-review/` as raw evidence; current truth remains this log.
- Next: docs slice 1.

## Iteration 2 - README / ROADMAP Single Truth Source

- Target: remove duplicate v0.5 Dashboard rules from public docs while preserving ordinary user entry points.
- Changes:
  - `README.md`: collapsed v0.5 monitor detail to a Signal Desk app flow plus a short expert command appendix; removed live-delivery examples from the main path.
  - `README.zh-CN.md`: same cleanup in Chinese; changed the human flow from `Inbox / Runs` to `Review / Runs`.
  - `ROADMAP.md`: replaced detailed Dashboard hardening bullets with a pointer to `docs/v0.5-alpha-alert-review-inbox.md`; roadmap now keeps phase direction and exit criteria.
- Verification:
  - `rg` check found no remaining `delivery-mode live`, stale `Monitor & Inbox`, `Tokens are never saved`, or duplicated Dashboard hardening phrases in README / ROADMAP surfaces.
  - `git diff --check`: passed, with only Windows line-ending warnings.
- External review:
  - Directly addressed reviewer B P1 findings on README / ROADMAP duplication and live CLI path exposure.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: README / ROADMAP should point to v0.5 authority instead of mirroring it.
  - Covered: token save semantics now say local credential storage and no UI echo / SQLite / manifest / report / docs persistence.
- Task state: checkpoint ready after docs verification.
- `needs_human`: none for this slice.
- Residual risk: README is now less exhaustive; expert users must follow the linked agent contract or v0.5 authority for detail.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: no new raw artifacts.
- Next: UX slice 3, Start and Runs decision hierarchy.

## Iteration 3 - Start / Runs Decision Hierarchy

- Target: remove the ready-state "multiple equal next steps" problem called out by the UX reviewers.
- Changes:
  - `dashboard/src/components/actions.tsx`: ready-state Start now shows one recommended action. Pending Review cards win over scanning; scanning wins over automation. Other controls are collapsed.
  - `dashboard/src/main.tsx`: Start can open the Review tab directly when there are pending cards.
  - `dashboard/src/components/runs.tsx`: Runs now converts recent health into a decision summary, with failed runs and diagnostics above card volume.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/*`: mobile touch targets were tightened for Runs report links and delivery toggles; the Start next-action badge no longer stretches into a full-width stripe.
  - `tools/quality_visual_audit.py`: added a reusable real-browser screenshot/audit helper so later passes do not depend on one-off scripts.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 10 files / 71 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0240/`.
  - Mobile Start / Review / Runs / Settings: no horizontal overflow and zero small-target findings in the visual audit.
- External review:
  - Directly addressed reviewer A P1 Start hierarchy and P2 Runs summary.
  - Directly addressed reviewer C mobile touch-target follow-up for Runs report links and Settings delivery toggle.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: Start should prefer Review when cards are pending; delivery target setup is optional and must not seize the main path.
  - Accepted: Runs must state whether failures, diagnostics, or Review work should get attention first.
- Task state: checkpoint ready.
- `needs_human`: final taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: desktop compact controls remain below 44px where pointer precision is assumed; mobile audit is clean for the current data shape.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: screenshots and `visual-audit.json` retained under the timestamped evidence folder only.
- Next: UX slice 4, mobile Review density and long-title scan.

## Iteration 4 - Mobile Review Action Visibility

- Target: make the first Review card actionable within the mobile first viewport instead of making the user scroll through supporting detail first.
- Changes:
  - `dashboard/src/components/inbox.tsx`: added a mobile quick-action strip directly under the card title and rating.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/inbox.css` and `dashboard/src/styles/responsive.css`: mobile cards hide the duplicate lower action rail until profile-diff mode is opened; primary actions stay 44px+.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 10 files / 71 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0250/`.
  - Mobile Review: no horizontal overflow, zero small-target findings, and first-card actions visible above the reason/source/report detail stack.
- External review:
  - Addresses the ADHD/ordinary-user complaint that Review cards looked like reading material before they looked actionable.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: mobile users need action buttons before lower-priority evidence chips.
  - Preserved: desktop keeps the right-hand action rail and dense comparison layout.
- Task state: checkpoint ready.
- `needs_human`: final taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: very long private card titles may still push actions lower than desired; needs sampling with real data during acceptance.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: screenshots and audit JSON stay in the timestamped evidence folder.
- Next: Settings long-list disclosure and source-management copy.

## Iteration 5 - Settings Source List Progressive Disclosure

- Target: stop Saved Sources from becoming a default 82-row management wall on the ordinary Settings path.
- Changes:
  - `dashboard/src/components/settings.tsx`: Saved Sources now defaults to summary/search plus a deliberate "Show first 8" action. Search or topic filters still reveal matching rows immediately.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/settings/sources.css` and `dashboard/src/styles/responsive.css`: added a compact saved-source gate with mobile-safe layout.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 10 files / 71 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0305/`.
  - Mobile Start / Review / Runs / Settings: no horizontal overflow and zero small-target findings.
- External review:
  - Addresses reviewer A/B complaint that Settings opened as a source-management wall instead of an app-user task surface.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: source rows should be available on demand, not forced into the first Settings pass.
  - Preserved: search, topic filtering, and the first-page management list remain one click or one typed query away.
- Task state: checkpoint ready.
- `needs_human`: final taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: the 20260511-0300 screenshot run caught a transient local API error; 20260511-0305 re-run was healthy and is the evidence for this slice.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: invalid transient-error screenshots kept only as raw evidence; use 0305 as current visual reference.
- Next: desktop compact-control polish and local API error-state clarity.

## Iteration 6 - Local API Error Recovery

- Target: keep transient local API failures from dumping raw server language into the UI or stealing the user's main task.
- Changes:
  - `dashboard/src/api/client.ts`: `errorMessage` now normalizes network failures, HTTP 500s, and invalid response shapes into short local recovery guidance.
  - `dashboard/src/components/settings.tsx`: Saved Sources error title now says what needs attention instead of only saying unavailable.
  - `dashboard/src/components/actions.tsx`: optional Telegram setup no longer becomes the active Start step when the workspace is already ready and Review cards exist.
  - Added focused tests for error normalization and ready-state Telegram optionality.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 11 files / 75 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0325/`.
  - Start remained Review-first even while a local API subcall surfaced a normalized recovery notice.
- External review:
  - Addresses the ordinary-user/ADHD concern that raw "Internal Server Error" text is high-friction and low-action.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: API subcall failures may show a notice, but they must not redirect a ready user away from pending Review work.
  - Preserved: specific validation errors, such as invalid topic tags, still pass through unchanged.
- Task state: checkpoint ready.
- `needs_human`: final taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: if the primary `/api/state` endpoint fails, the app still has to fall back to the empty/error shell; that path needs a separate visual pass.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: screenshot evidence remains timestamped; no generated evidence was promoted into docs.
- Next: desktop compact-control polish if it does not make the desk less scannable.

## Iteration 7 - Desktop Primary Control Baseline

- Target: reduce desktop click-target friction without flattening the dense workstation layout.
- Changes:
  - Raised primary desktop button/input baselines to 44px for navigation, text buttons, journey controls, Telegram login fields, source import/search fields, delivery fields, and repository action buttons.
  - Left filter/evidence chips compact so Review and Runs remain scannable.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 11 files / 75 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0340/`.
  - Mobile Start / Review / Runs / Settings: no horizontal overflow and zero small-target findings.
  - Desktop remaining sub-44 findings are compact filter/evidence chips or report links, not primary buttons.
- External review:
  - Orchestra/KIMI re-audit `11700c4a7a79` completed.
  - Reviewer verdict: not acceptance-ready; Iteration 7 improved metrics but did not address the largest user-visible failures.
  - Process correction: future reviewer gates must use Orchestra `assign / poll / show / rate`, not a one-off handoff, because the user explicitly requested the updated workflow.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: raise primary controls.
  - Accepted: do not count this slice as UX acceptance; treat it only as a rollback checkpoint.
  - Accepted: next high-value slice is Runs information restructuring: mobile timeline readability plus grouped/de-duplicated recent evidence.
  - Rejected for now: blindly turning every badge/filter/evidence chip into 44px blocks, because it would reduce scan density without clear benefit.
- Task state: checkpoint ready.
- `needs_human`: final taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: KIMI still flags desktop Review single-card dead space, mobile Runs timeline density, repeated run rows, mobile Review filter/action density, and Settings maze.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: screenshot evidence remains timestamped.
- Next: commit this checkpoint, then rebuild the Runs surface.

## Iteration 8 - Runs Timeline And Evidence De-Duplication

- Target: address KIMI's Runs critique directly: mobile timeline readability and repeated Recent Evidence rows.
- Changes:
  - `dashboard/src/components/runs.tsx`: added compact mobile timeline segments, outcome-first run labels, evidence grouping, and same-day same-profile same-outcome clustering.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/runs.css` and `dashboard/src/styles/responsive.css`: mobile hides the seven-label day strip and uses compact timeline tiles; grouped evidence rows keep desktop density without repeating near-identical rows.
  - `dashboard/src/components/runs.test.tsx`: covered outcome labels, grouping, clustering, diagnostic-title priority, and compact timeline behavior.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run src/components/runs.test.tsx`: 1 file / 9 tests passed.
  - `npm test -- --run`: 11 files / 81 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0314-runs/`.
  - Mobile Runs scroll height dropped from 2380 to 1317 in the screenshot audit; desktop Runs is one viewport high again.
  - Mobile Start / Review / Runs / Settings: no horizontal overflow and zero small-target findings.
- External review:
  - Orchestra/KIMI task `badd817414f0` rejected the mobile timeline and mobile Evidence cut-off as P0.
  - Gemini task `852700f86744` failed with provider rate limit; it is not counted as a pass.
  - Claude fallback task `673d63a4fdcf` returned only a generic Orchestra result; the useful report was later recovered from the local Claude plans folder and handled in Iteration 10.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: grouping without clustering was insufficient; repeated OCR rows still created noise, so the same slice was tightened before checkpoint.
  - Accepted: diagnostic labels outrank aggregate alert volume, so `OCR media skipped` remains the row title even when the cluster includes alert candidates.
  - Rejected by KIMI: the segmented mobile timeline approach destroyed daily temporal structure; Iteration 9 reverted/reworked it into per-day compact buckets.
- Task state: superseded by Iteration 9 remediation.
- `needs_human`: final visual/taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: Review single-card dead space, mobile Review filter density, and Settings maze remain outside this slice.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: screenshots and audit JSON stay in timestamped evidence folders only.
- Next: fix KIMI P0 issues before claiming Runs progress.

## Iteration 9 - KIMI Runs Remediation And Review Backlog Map

- Target: repair KIMI P0 findings on Runs and remove the desktop Review single-card island.
- Changes:
  - Runs mobile timeline now preserves seven daily positions with compact day cells instead of merging six empty days into one ambiguous range.
  - Runs failed-run summary no longer repeats the exact failure count already visible in the timeline and evidence row.
  - Runs mobile Evidence rows put the report link above lower-priority bars/status details; mobile hides repeated row details so the first report link is visible in the first viewport.
  - Runs desktop report links now meet the 44px target.
  - Review desktop now shows a backlog map under the current filtered card so the single-card view no longer floats over dead space; the map is hidden on mobile to avoid duplicating the filter wall.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 11 files / 80 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0323-kimi-fix/`.
  - Mobile Runs scroll height is 983, below the 1000px remediation target from KIMI.
  - Desktop Runs small-target count is zero after the report-link fix.
  - Mobile Start / Review / Runs / Settings: no horizontal overflow and zero small-target findings.
- External review:
  - KIMI findings were accepted and remediated; process-integrity review still pending.
  - Qwen later noted that this checkpoint also included desktop Review backlog-map work; this was useful but not strictly part of KIMI Runs remediation.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: previous `compact timeline segments` wording was overclaiming; the UI now keeps daily temporal structure.
  - Accepted: Report access must be visible before decorative/count details on mobile.
  - Accepted: desktop Review needs backlog context when only one latest-action card is visible.
- Task state: checkpoint ready after local verification; Qwen integrity gate pending.
- `needs_human`: final visual/taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: mobile Review filter density and Settings maze remain open candidates.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: generated review packets and screenshots stay under `output/quality-review/`.
- Next: commit checkpoint, run Qwen process-integrity review, then continue to the next high-impact slice.

## Iteration 10 - Claude Fallback Findings

- Target: incorporate the fallback reviewer report that Claude Code wrote to `C:\Users\Administrator\.claude\plans\fallback-gemini-reviewer-vast-nest.md` instead of returning through Orchestra.
- Changes:
  - Multi-run evidence report links now say `Latest report · 1 of N runs`, avoiding the false impression that one report contains all clustered cards/alerts.
  - Info-only diagnostics no longer escalate to the warning/attention group.
  - Run health success rate no longer treats running/pending scans as failed.
  - Mobile Runs increased compact timeline readability and strengthened evidence group separation.
  - Mobile Runs hides repeated metadata/no-report lines so actual Report actions appear earlier.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run src/components/runs.test.tsx`: 1 file / 9 tests passed.
  - `npm test -- --run`: 11 files / 81 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0328-claude-fallback-fix/`.
  - Mobile Runs scroll height is 945; no horizontal overflow; mobile small-target count remains zero.
- External review:
  - Claude fallback report was useful but hidden in the local Claude plans folder; accepted P0/P1 findings and remediated them.
  - Qwen process-integrity task `a48f01568526` found no P0 and gave a conditional go, but required the Iteration 8/10 Claude fallback contradiction to be corrected.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: aggregate counts require explicit report scope.
  - Accepted: info diagnostics should not be red attention work.
  - Deferred: global-normalized count bars remain P2 unless later review says they mislead in real data.
- Task state: checkpoint ready; Qwen process-integrity review later gave conditional go after doc corrections.
- `needs_human`: final visual/taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: mobile Review filter density and Settings maze remain open.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: no Claude plan file was copied into project docs; this log keeps only the actionable summary.
- Next: commit checkpoint and run process-integrity review.

## Iteration 11 - Settings Task Switcher

- Target: reduce the Settings configuration maze for ordinary app users without deleting source, notification, learning, or repository controls.
- Changes:
  - `dashboard/src/components/settings.tsx`: added a three-task switcher for Sources, Notify, and Learning; only the selected settings task is shown.
  - `dashboard/src/components/status-rail.tsx`: collapsed Repository controls behind a status summary so maintenance controls do not dominate the default Settings task.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/settings/layout.css`, `repository.css`, `sources.css`, and `responsive.css`: added responsive task switch styling and fixed Settings source topic chips to 44px target size.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 11 files / 81 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0342-settings-switch-targets/`.
  - Desktop Settings scroll height is 1000 with zero small targets.
  - Mobile Settings scroll height is 1575, down from the earlier 3051px baseline; no horizontal overflow and zero small targets.
- External review:
  - KIMI task `6d1cd0d36645` returned `pass-with-risks`.
  - Gemini Flash task `2d1b71a2a758` failed with a Gemini API error and is not counted as a pass.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: Settings needed task-level IA, not another explanation block.
  - Accepted: Repository controls are expert/maintenance actions and should not be first-scan noise.
  - Accepted from KIMI P1: mobile switcher needed information scent; fixed in Iteration 12.
  - Accepted from KIMI P1: empty Feedback count should not read as amber alert; fixed in Iteration 12.
  - Accepted from KIMI P1/P2: Source Evidence and Add Sources needed lower-noise placement; fixed in Iteration 12.
- Task state: checkpoint committed; KIMI findings fed into Iteration 12.
- `needs_human`: final visual/taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: second independent reviewer signal is degraded because Gemini failed.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: screenshot evidence remains timestamped under `output/quality-review/`; no generated packet promoted into docs.
- Next: continue with KIMI P1 fixes and mobile Review density.

## Iteration 12 - Review Density And KIMI Settings Remediation

- Target: reduce mobile Review first-viewport noise and immediately fix accepted KIMI P1 findings from the Settings review.
- Changes:
  - `dashboard/src/components/inbox.tsx` and `dashboard/src/styles/inbox.css`: mobile Review now defaults to a single current-filter control; all filters expand only when requested.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/responsive.css`: mobile Review actions now fit in one row; Keep and Skip keep visible labels, secondary actions are icon+aria-label controls.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/actions.css`: Start `Open settings` CTA now meets the 44px target.
  - `dashboard/src/components/settings.tsx`: Settings labels changed to Sources / Alerts / Feedback; Source Evidence moved outside task-specific panels; Add Sources collapses by default when saved sources already exist.
  - `dashboard/src/styles/settings/layout.css` and `settings/sources.css`: empty Feedback count is muted, mobile switcher keeps short detail text, and Add Sources summary is a 44px target.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --run`: 11 files / 81 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Real-browser screenshots and metrics: `output/quality-review/20260511-0357-review-settings-p1-fix/` plus final mobile action-label check in `output/quality-review/20260511-0359-review-action-labels/`.
  - Desktop Start / Review / Runs / Settings: no horizontal overflow and zero small-target findings.
  - Mobile Start / Review / Runs / Settings: no horizontal overflow and zero small-target findings.
  - Mobile Review scroll height is 898, down from 1008 before this slice.
  - Mobile Settings scroll height is 1256, down from 1575 after the first switcher pass and 3051 in the earlier baseline.
- External review:
  - KIMI P1 findings from task `6d1cd0d36645` were accepted and remediated locally.
  - Gemini Flash task `2d1b71a2a758` failed; reviewer gate remains degraded until another independent reviewer checks the post-fix surface.
- Triage:
  - Accepted: filter wall should be collapsed by default on mobile.
  - Accepted: Repository can stay outside the task switcher as a collapsed Settings-level maintenance summary; Source Evidence must not be trapped inside Sources only.
  - Accepted: returning users with 82 saved sources should see management/search before a full Add Sources form.
  - Deferred: section-switch transition animation remains P3 polish.
- Task state: local checkpoint ready; second reviewer still needed.
- `needs_human`: final visual/taste acceptance remains user-owned.
- Residual risk: icon-only secondary actions may still need reviewer judgment; Gemini failure means no full heterogeneous pass yet.
- Memory closeout: pending.
- Hook enforcement: manual.
- Artifact hygiene: screenshot evidence remains timestamped under `output/quality-review/`; transient reviewer packet remains under ignored output evidence.
- Next: commit checkpoint, dispatch another independent reviewer for the post-fix Settings/Review surface, then continue with the next highest-value app polish.
